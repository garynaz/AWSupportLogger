## Inspiration
This app was designed to facilitate interaction interactions between clients and IT Support Specialists as an alterantive to using email.
The idea is to provide clients with a platform where they can immediately check on the status of their ticket submissions, while also 
having the option to chat directly with the IT Specialist who is working on fulfilling the client's request.
